### Day 1: March 3rd, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued researching and working on pure Javascript AJAX requests for FreeCodeCamp wiki viewer project.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot of reading and video watching. I'm trying mostly to get a good understanding of how to approach this project and future projects. I want to approach it from a pure Javascript approach rather than using jQuery or Angular.
