### Day 1: March 3rd, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued researching and working on pure Javascript AJAX requests for FreeCodeCamp wiki viewer project.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot of reading and video watching. I'm trying mostly to get a good understanding of how to approach this project and future projects. I want to approach it from a pure Javascript approach rather than using jQuery or Angular.

### Day 2: March 4th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with a Code Wars KATA. Then continued work on FreeCodeCamp wiki viewer project. Watched videos and read regarding AJAX and pure javascript. I unfortunately did not make much progress on the project.

**Thoughts**: I am unsure of why the request isn't yielding any results. There are no errors showing. I will put more time and effort into this tomorrow and will finish the javascript for this project!

### Day 3: March 5th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got a working a xmlrequest. Just need to figure out how to parse Wiki api text response into JSON.

**Thoughts**: The request gave me results, just not ones I can turn into HTML.

### Day 4: March 7th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Not able to parse JSON still using javascript. Moved over to using jQuery which makes the call so much easier and gives me parseable data.

**Thoughts**: It's all ready to turn it into HTML.
