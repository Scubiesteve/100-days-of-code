### Day 1: March 3rd, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued researching and working on pure Javascript AJAX requests for FreeCodeCamp wiki viewer project.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot of reading and video watching. I'm trying mostly to get a good understanding of how to approach this project and future projects. I want to approach it from a pure Javascript approach rather than using jQuery or Angular.

### Day 2: March 4th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with a Code Wars KATA. Then continued work on FreeCodeCamp wiki viewer project. Watched videos and read regarding AJAX and pure javascript. I unfortunately did not make much progress on the project.

**Thoughts**: I am unsure of why the request isn't yielding any results. There are no errors showing. I will put more time and effort into this tomorrow and will finish the javascript for this project!
